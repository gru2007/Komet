# Deliverfile - Fastlane deliver configuration
# This file allows you to customize deliver behavior

# Skip app version update to prevent version normalization from 1.0 to 1.0.0
# This prevents Fastlane from updating the version in App Store Connect
# This allows using existing version "1.0" in TestFlight instead of creating "1.0.0"
# Note: The version in IPA will still be "1.0.0" (normalized by Flutter),
# but Fastlane will not update the version in App Store Connect metadata
